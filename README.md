### Tips and templates for sharing data and script with the world 

## Background

Reproducibility is a central tenet of the scientific method. 
But in ecology and other field sciences that trope of Methods section advice -- 
*Explain your study so that anyone else could go and do it again* --
rings hollow when it is unlikely anyone will return to *your* study site and impossible to do it during *your* study year. 
But data collection is only one part of the scientific process, and I would argue that as data become more context-specific (and therefore less reproducible) it becomes more essential that other parts of the scientific process are themselves reproducible. 

I'm thinking here of **data analysis** and **presentation**. 

The more easily results of a benchtop trial are conveyed simply, as in "more" or "less", the more likely someone can easily reproduce the study in their own lab. 
But in ecology, results are often highly dependent on how those data are treated once brought in from the field. 
If others can't re-sample your data, isn't it even more important that they be able to re-analyze them? 

Data transparency and shareability are being increasingly emphasized as part of open-source, open-access movements in science. 
The arguments for transparency and access are myriad and I don't necessarily agree with them all. 
But when we consider the impossibility of collecting for ourselves the data reported (in studies both stimulating and stupefying), it stands to reason that we be able to re-run each other's analyses to confirm, learn, teach, and advance or refute as necessary.  

## Purpose

This project is meant to facilitate the sharing of both data and data analysis, especially as part of the publication process. 
Many journals encourage public data archiving, and this is good; some even require it, which I find unnecessary.
In either case, data *availability* is only part of the process; especially with the complicated data workflows and statistical analyses used in ecology, it very much matters what authors did to their data between the spreadsheet and the graph. 
And in any event, even posting data -- let alone script -- can be an unfamiliar, daunting task for some researchers. 

It is my hope that colleagues can use the tips and templates posted here to make their data and script available to the rest of us. 
While it might be cool if we all shared data via our own github respositories, this project is designed to help authors make simple `.zip` files that can be uploaded with their papers as supplemental information. 

## Getting started 

The two main folders in this project are

* Example 
  - Data files for a made-up dataset
  - Example `.R` and `.Rmd` files so others can click and compile

* Templates
  - simply blanks of the above for authors' own use in generating their own `.zip` supplementary files
