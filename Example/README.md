# Data and script sharing examples

Have you completed a manuscript and are keen to share your data and script, but don't really know what that *looks like*? 
Here is a basic example that is more than enough to make an engaging, useful, and *clear* supplemental data folder you can upload with your manuscript as a `.zip` file. 

## Getting started 

Your best bet is to download the entire DaytaShayR Example folder as a `.zip` file and unzip it to your desktop or thumb drive. 
Put it in a folder you can find later because you need to update the `R` script with a file path to the folder to get the most out of the example scripts. 

*Note of course this whole thing assumes you have `R` installed on your machine. 
If not, run over to [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/) and get it. 
While you are at it, you might as well install [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), too.*
